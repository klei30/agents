# Dialoqbase âš¡

Dialoqbase is a web application that allows you to create custom chatbots with your own knowledge base.  It uses powerful language models to generate responses and PostgreSQL for vector search and storing the knowledge base

Here's a demo of how it works (v0.0.1):

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the docker directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n4ze3m/dialoqbase.git
cd dialoqbase/docker
```

2. Edit the `imp.env` file and set the following environment variables:

- On Linux:

```bash
nano imp.env
```
or 

```bash
vim imp.env
```

- On Windows:

```bash
notepad imp.env
```


Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable to your OpenAI API key. You can obtain an API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)


3. Run the docker-compose file:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

or

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

5. Log in using the default credentials:

```bash
username: admin
password: admin
```

_Important: After the first login, remember to change the default credentials._
